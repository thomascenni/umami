## Manual Deploy

3. Click on "+New/Web Service" to host Umami application

4. Connect to this public repository: [https://github.com/thomascenni/umami](https://github.com/thomascenni/umami)

5. Click on Continue, select a name for your web service, for example "umami"

6. Before creating the service, click on "Advanced" and setup the two environment variables:
   
   1. DATABASE_URL, with the connection string coming from your PostgreSQL service (point 2)
   2. HASH_SALT, with a random generated string


Once the web service is deployed, you'll be redirected to the admin page, login with user "admin" and password "umami".
